# 🐾 MAC - Meow Age Calculator 🐱

A simple C program that converts your cat's age (in years and months) to its approximate human age — because curiosity isn’t just for cats. 😸

## 🧠 How It Works
- Prompts for your cat's name 🐈
- Asks for age in years and months 📅
- Calculates total cat months 📊
- Converts to human age 👤
- Classifies your cat as a kitten, adult, or senior 🎯

## 📚 Age Conversion Logic
Based on the guide from [Daily Paws](https://www.dailypaws.com/cats-kittens/health-care/cat-age-in-human-years):

- 1st year = ~15 human years  
- 2nd year = ~10 human years  
- Each additional year = ~4 human years

## ⚙️ Compile & Run

```bash
gcc -o mac mac.c
./mac
