# C Practice — My First Steps in Programming

This repo contains small C programs I wrote while learning to code through CS50x.

💡 Topics I'm exploring:
- Variables and data types
- Conditionals and loops
- Functions and arrays
- Problem-solving basics

These are my own practice files — not official CS50 problem set solutions.

🛠️ Still learning, still improving!
