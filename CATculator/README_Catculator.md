# ðŸ˜¸ CATculator - Cat to Human Age Converter

A simple C program that converts your cat's age (in years and months) to its approximate human age â€” because curiosity isnâ€™t just for cats. ðŸ˜¸

## How It Works
- Prompts for your cat's name 
- Asks for age in years and months 
- Calculates total cat months 
- Converts to human age 
- Classifies your cat as a kitten, adult, or senior

## Age Conversion Logic
Based on the guide from [Daily Paws](https://www.dailypaws.com/cats-kittens/health-care/cat-age-in-human-years):

- 1st year = ~15 human years  
- 2nd year = ~10 human years  
- Each additional year = ~4 human years

## Compile & Run

```bash
gcc -o cat cat.c
./cat
